Selection tools can be used to select objects in an image to resize/delete/copy/move the objects. There are many types of selection tools such as rectangles or free-form selection tool, sometimes free-form selection tools are called **Lasso’s**. You can imagine a lasso as a rope surrounding your selection. Unfortunately, selection using ordinary lasso’s can be tedious and boring.

In Photoshop, there is a more advanced version of ordinary lasso’s called **Magnetic Lasso Tool**.   Magnetic Lasso Tool is a lasso that automatically snaps to the objects’ boundaries. You can watch a demo of it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rQEctxkjBM&ab_channel=CreativeBloq).

The technical term for the Magnetic Lasso Tool is Livewire or <strong>Intelligent Scissors</strong>. In this project we want to implement a simple magnetic lasso using image processing, graphs, and greedy algorithms.

## Features
• Real-time livewire drawing 

• Cropping photo after selection

• Saving the cropped photo to multiple supported file formats

• Ability to automatically drop anchor points with different frequencies

• Simple GUI
